## Exercises

The course materials contain exercises that you can create on your own. The course clips will remind you whenever there is an accompanying exercise. You can find the exercise files as Cypress tests in `cypress/e2e/assignments`. Each assignment has comments to point you in the right direction. If you get stuck, you can take a peak at the solutions in `cypress/e2e/solutions`.
