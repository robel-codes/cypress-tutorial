## 📚 Course Overview

End-to-end testing can be tricky in modern web applications, but Cypress makes it easier and more reliable. This course will teach you how to set up, write, and debug Cypress tests for real-world web applications with confidence.

You’ll learn:

* Introduction to Cypress and its unique features
* Installing Cypress and setting up your environment
* Writing your first tests for realistic user journeys
* Handling asynchronous behavior and smart waiting
* Using Cypress features like spies, stubs, and clocks

All examples in this course use **Bethany’s Pie Shop**, a React application built with Next.js.
